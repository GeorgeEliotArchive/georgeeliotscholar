## Notes for development

1. If you want to change redirect link for the other items on the navbar, you must change them in the <navbar.js> file and then change them in the route object in <app.js>.
2. I have decided than the additional projects (chronology and relationship mapping) are not needed for the sister test sites. This will help reduce loading stress. 
3. For now, I will forego doing any significant design changes to test sister sites. I will focus solely on development, but will include enough changes that there is a distinction.
